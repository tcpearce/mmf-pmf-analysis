Environmental Interpretation Notes:
-----------------------------------
• Strong positive pressure correlation may indicate:
  - High pressure system influences (stable conditions)
  - Reduced atmospheric mixing
  - Accumulation of local emissions
  - Anticyclonic weather patterns

• Strong negative pressure correlation may indicate:
  - Low pressure system influences (unstable conditions)
  - Enhanced atmospheric mixing and ventilation
  - Storm/precipitation scavenging effects
  - Cyclonic weather patterns with dilution

• Factors with weak pressure correlation may indicate:
  - Sources independent of meteorological conditions
  - Industrial sources with constant emissions
  - Indoor/sheltered emission sources
  - Regional background contributions
