None Temperature-Factor Analysis Summary
==================================================

Total matched data points: 93
Temperature columns analyzed: TEMP

TEMP Statistics:
  Range: 14.1 - 24.2 oC
  Mean: 18.2 oC
  Median: 17.8 oC
  Std deviation: 2.9 oC

Factor-Temperature Correlations:
------------------------------
Factor 1:
  Mean contribution: nan
  Std deviation: nan
  Correlation with temperature: 0.000
  P-value: 1.000e+00
  Interpretation: very weak negative correlation, not significant (ns)

Factor 2:
  Mean contribution: nan
  Std deviation: nan
  Correlation with temperature: 0.000
  P-value: 1.000e+00
  Interpretation: very weak negative correlation, not significant (ns)

Environmental Interpretation Notes:
-----------------------------------
• Strong positive temperature correlation may indicate:
  - Biogenic emissions (vegetation)
  - Photochemical secondary formation
  - Evaporation of volatile compounds
  - Increased mixing height effects

• Strong negative temperature correlation may indicate:
  - Residential heating sources
  - Incomplete combustion in cold conditions
  - Reduced atmospheric mixing
  - Seasonal industrial patterns

• Factors with weak temperature correlation may indicate:
  - Industrial sources with constant emissions
  - Traffic-related sources (less temperature dependent)
  - Regional background contributions
