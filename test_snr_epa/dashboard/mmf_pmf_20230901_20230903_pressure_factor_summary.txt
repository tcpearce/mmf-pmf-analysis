Pressure columns analyzed: Pressure

Pressure Statistics:
  Range: 992.0 - 1014.5 hPa
  Mean: 1003.8 hPa
  Median: 1005.0 hPa
  Std deviation: 6.4 hPa

Factor-Pressure Correlations:
------------------------------
Factor 1:
  Mean contribution: nan
  Std deviation: nan
  Correlation with pressure: 0.000
  P-value: 1.000e+00
  Interpretation: very weak negative correlation, not significant (ns)

Factor 2:
  Mean contribution: nan
  Std deviation: nan
  Correlation with pressure: 0.000
  P-value: 1.000e+00
  Interpretation: very weak negative correlation, not significant (ns)

Environmental Interpretation Notes:
-----------------------------------
• Strong positive pressure correlation may indicate:
  - High pressure system influences (stable conditions)
  - Reduced atmospheric mixing
  - Accumulation of local emissions
  - Anticyclonic weather patterns

• Strong negative pressure correlation may indicate:
  - Low pressure system influences (unstable conditions)
  - Enhanced atmospheric mixing and ventilation
  - Storm/precipitation scavenging effects
  - Cyclonic weather patterns with dilution

• Factors with weak pressure correlation may indicate:
  - Sources independent of meteorological conditions
  - Industrial sources with constant emissions
  - Indoor/sheltered emission sources
  - Regional background contributions
