# Malodour Complaint Data Integration Plan
## PMF Source Apportionment Ground Truth Validation

### Executive Summary
This document outlines the comprehensive integration of malodour complaint data as ground truth validation for the PMF source apportionment analysis system. The integration will transform the analysis from purely statistical to validated environmental impact assessment.

---

## 1. Data Structure Design

### 1.1 Complaint Data Format
```python
# Expected complaint data structure
complaint_data = {
    'date': pd.Timestamp,           # Daily complaint aggregation
    'complaint_count': int,         # Number of complaints per day  
    'severity_avg': float,          # Average severity (1-5 scale)
    'complaint_types': list,        # Categories: odour, dust, noise, etc.
    'time_of_day_dist': dict,       # Hourly distribution of complaints
    'weather_conditions': str,      # Associated weather at time of complaints
    'source_attribution': str       # If available from complaint records
}
```

### 1.2 Integration with Existing Parquet Structure
- **New column**: `complaint_count` added to MMF parquet files
- **Temporal alignment**: Hourly complaint data interpolated to match MMF sampling
- **Missing data handling**: Zero complaints = 0, not NaN (important distinction)
