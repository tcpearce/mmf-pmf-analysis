# MMF Station Mapping Correction - Migration Completed

**Date:** September 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY  
**QA Approval:** ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED  

## Summary

Critical data integrity issue has been resolved: MMF numbers were incorrectly mapped to station names in the original parquet datasets. All mappings have been corrected and verified.

## Corrections Applied

### Before (INCORRECT):
- **MMF1** → Silverdale Pumping Station ❌
- **MMF2** → Cemetery Road ❌  
- **MMF6** → Galingale View ❌
- **MMF9** → Maries Way ❌

### After (CORRECT):
- **MMF1** → Cemetery Road ✅
- **MMF2** → Silverdale Pumping Station ✅
- **MMF6** → Fire Station ✅ (placeholder - no data available)
- **MMF9** → Galingale View ✅
- **Maries Way** → No MMF number ✅

## Files Updated

### New Corrected Parquet Files (mmf_parquet_final/):
1. `MMF1_Cemetery_Road_combined_data.parquet` (356,361 records)
2. `MMF2_Silverdale_Pumping_Station_combined_data.parquet` (454,972 records) 
3. `MMF6_Fire_Station_combined_data.parquet` (0 records - placeholder)
4. `MMF9_Galingale_View_combined_data.parquet` (463,527 records)
5. `Maries_Way_combined_data.parquet` (95,721 records)

### Schema Enhancements:
- ✅ Added `mmf_id` column with correct MMF numbers
- ✅ Added `station_name` column for clarity  
- ✅ Upgraded schema version to v2
- ✅ Enhanced metadata with correction tracking
- ✅ All original data preserved and properly processed

## Data Integrity Verification

### Quality Assurance Results:
- ✅ **5/5 files passed** all QA checks
- ✅ MMF number to station name mappings verified correct
- ✅ All required columns present (datetime, mmf_id, station_name)
- ✅ Schema version v2 confirmed across all files
- ✅ Metadata consistency verified
- ✅ Date ranges and record counts validated

### Coverage Verified:
- **MMF1 (Cemetery Road)**: 2021-04-12 to 2024-08-31
- **MMF2 (Silverdale Pumping Station)**: 2021-03-04 to 2025-07-01  
- **MMF6 (Fire Station)**: No data available (placeholder created)
- **MMF9 (Galingale View)**: 2021-03-05 to 2025-07-31
- **Maries Way**: 2024-09-02 to 2025-07-31

## Backups Created

Safety backups created before any changes:
- ✅ `mmf_data_backup_20250914_174718/` - Original raw data files
- ✅ `mmf_parquet_backup_20250914_174737/` - Original parquet files
- ✅ All processing logs and QA reports saved

## Impact Assessment

### Critical Issues Resolved:
1. **Data Location Confusion**: Analyses referencing "MMF1" will now correctly analyze Cemetery Road data instead of Silverdale Pumping Station
2. **Research Integrity**: Historical analyses using incorrect mappings will need review and potential re-running
3. **Reporting Accuracy**: All dashboards and reports using MMF identifiers will now show correct station data

### Downstream Dependencies:
⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Any existing analysis, dashboards, or reports that reference MMF numbers will need to be reviewed as the station data they were analyzing has changed.

## Files for Production Use

**Primary Dataset:** `mmf_parquet_final/`
- Contains all corrected parquet files ready for production use
- Schema version v2 with enhanced metadata
- Full QA approval

**Configuration:** `station_lookup.json`
- Authoritative mapping reference
- Version-controlled station name mappings

## Migration Scripts Created

Reusable scripts for future maintenance:
- `process_mmf_corrected.py` - Main correction processing script
- `qa_verify_corrections.py` - Quality assurance validation
- `relocate_mmf_files.py` - File organization utility

## Next Steps Required

1. **Update Analysis Scripts**: Review and update any scripts that reference MMF numbers
2. **Dashboard Updates**: Verify all monitoring dashboards show correct station names
3. **Research Review**: Consider re-running critical analyses that may have been affected
4. **Team Notification**: Inform all stakeholders of the correction

## Verification Commands

To verify the corrections:

```bash
# Check corrected parquet files
python3 qa_verify_corrections.py

# Verify specific file contents
python3 -c "
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_parquet('mmf_parquet_final/MMF1_Cemetery_Road_combined_data.parquet')
print(f'MMF1 -> {df.station_name.iloc[0]} ({len(df):,} records)')
"
```
