Environmental Interpretation Notes:
-----------------------------------
• Strong positive temperature correlation may indicate:
  - Biogenic emissions (vegetation)
  - Photochemical secondary formation
  - Evaporation of volatile compounds
  - Increased mixing height effects

• Strong negative temperature correlation may indicate:
  - Residential heating sources
  - Incomplete combustion in cold conditions
  - Reduced atmospheric mixing
  - Seasonal industrial patterns

• Factors with weak temperature correlation may indicate:
  - Industrial sources with constant emissions
  - Traffic-related sources (less temperature dependent)
  - Regional background contributions
