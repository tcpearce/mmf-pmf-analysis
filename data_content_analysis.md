# Air Quality Data Content Analysis

## Primary Pollutant Monitored
The main focus is on hydrogen sulphide (H₂S) monitoring, which is:
- Measured continuously at MMF sites
- Additionally monitored using passive diffusion tubes in specific studies
- Compared against WHO health guidelines for 24-hour averages

## Data Collection Methods & Measurements

### 1. Mobile Monitoring Facilities (MMFs)
Primary data collection includes:
- Hydrogen sulphide (H₂S) concentrations
- Continuous measurements
- 24-hour averaging periods
- Comparison with WHO guidelines
- Located at key sites like MMF9 Galingale View

### 2. Passive Diffusion Tube Study (April-July 2022)
Specific study focusing on:
- H₂S concentrations
- Spatial distribution around the landfill site
- Analysis by Gradko International Ltd
- Used for validation of MMF data

### 3. Health Impact Assessments
These reports analyze:
- H₂S levels in relation to health guidelines
- Public health implications
- WHO guideline exceedances
- Health risk evaluations by UKHSA

## Report Types and Content

### Monthly Reports (April 2021 - March 2025)
Contain:
- Regular H₂S measurements
- 24-hour averages
- Exceedance notifications
- Basic trend analysis
- Comparison with health guidelines

### Interim Reports
More detailed analysis including:
- Local pollution source identification
- Odor nuisance assessment
- Environmental impact quantification
- Weather pattern correlations
- Trend analysis
- Site activity impacts

### Historical Studies (2017-2019)
Include:
- Baseline air quality data
- H₂S measurements
- Site-specific monitoring
- Historical trend analysis

### Exceedance Reports
Produced when:
- H₂S levels exceed WHO guidelines (24hr average)
- Trigger immediate partner notification
- Reports produced within 48 hours of exceedance
- Include immediate health impact assessments
- Contain public health advice from Staffordshire County Council
- Detail regulatory responses
- Involve coordination between Environment Agency and Public Health England

## Data Analysis Components

The reports typically include:
1. Raw Measurements
   - H₂S concentrations
   - Time series data
   - Location-specific readings

2. Analysis
   - Temporal trends
   - Spatial patterns
   - Weather correlations
   - Site activity correlations

3. Health Assessments
   - WHO guideline comparisons
   - Public health implications
   - Risk assessments

4. Additional Factors
   - Weather data
   - Site operations information
   - Local activity impacts

## Special Analysis

### MMF9 Galingale View Comparison Study
Compares:
- Two time periods (March-April 2021 vs 2022)
- Changes in H₂S levels
- Impact of site management measures
- Effectiveness of interventions

### Diffusion Tube Study
Provides:
- Spatial distribution of H₂S
- Validation of MMF measurements
- Additional monitoring points
- Coverage of wider area

## Data Limitations

1. Temporal Coverage
   - Gaps between 2019-2021
   - Most comprehensive data from 2021 onwards

2. Spatial Coverage
   - Fixed monitoring locations
   - Limited number of continuous monitoring points
   - Supplemented by periodic diffusion tube studies

3. Parameters
   - Primary focus on H₂S
   - Limited data on other potential pollutants

## Notes on Data Quality

- Continuous monitoring via MMFs provides high temporal resolution
- Multiple measurement methods (MMFs and diffusion tubes) allow cross-validation
- Regular calibration and maintenance of equipment
- Independent analysis by accredited laboratories
- Quality assurance through multiple reporting mechanisms
